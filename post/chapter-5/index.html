    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>
<p>In this project, I aimed at developing a machine learning project which would help airlines determine whether a customer would complete a booking or not. Airlines have realized that the buying cycle has changed in today&rsquo;s time, if you are hoping that customers would buy your tickets as they come to the airport you&rsquo;ve already lost so airlines want to take a more proactive approach to getting more customers booking with them. So we want to create a model that will help us pin point customers who will complete a booking and target such customers.</p>
<p><img src="https://David-230.github.io/david_portfolio/images/Aviation.jpg" alt="Local Image"></p>
<p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>In this phase I looked at the data I was given, inspected for trends and patterns that are influencing whether the customer would book a ticket. I looked at options in the data that are influencing whether a customer would buy the ticket or not, we looked at options like whether the customer wanted meals or not, whether the customer wanted extra baggage or not, flight route and flight hours. These are the factors that can influence whether a customer would complete a booking or not.</p>
<p><strong>Data Preparation:</strong></p>
<p>The initial phase involved meticulous data preparation, where I cleaned and processed the dataset to ensure its quality and relevance. I started by defining all the features just so we can understand what each feature represent. I proceeded to convert all categorical data into numerical values so that I can be able to build the model with the data because the model only understands numerical data, I converted the data using dummy variables.</p>
<p>Additionally, I engineered new features to improve the model&rsquo;s predictive capabilities, incorporating insights gained from the exploratory data analysis. One feature I engineered was to create an average of all the categorical binary features that were in the data. Another issue I had to deal with in the data was class imbalance, Okay let&rsquo;s start here, The problem we were given is a classification problem. Essentially we want to predict whether a user will fall within users who completed the booking(class A) or not(class B).</p>
<p>Therefore we had to train our model on two classes, a class with users who completed the bookings and a class with users who did not complete the booking. In our data we had a class with users who did not complete the booking being way more than users in a class with completed booking. This will create bias in our model if we train the model on this data therefore we had to deal with this class imbalance by reducing the class with higher number of users.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Model Training:</strong></p>
<p>For model training, I selected RandomForest algorithm the alorithm was suitable for this problem because it easily allows me to output information about how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive power. I trained the model on the quality data I have prepared and evaluated its performance by conducting cross-validation and visualizing the appropriate evaluation metrics. After some time of fine tuning the model, the model proved to perform at mean accuracy of 70%, mean precision of 67% and mean recall of 68% and mean F1 of 67%. The model proved to generalized well to unseen data even though I was not given data relating to specific customers but were only given general data. To improve the model we would need more customer specific data.</p>
<p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully developed a machine learning model for customer booking prediction.</li>
<li>Attained a commendable 70% accuracy rate, showcasing the model&rsquo;s reliability.</li>
<li>Implemented feature engineering strategies to enhance predictive power.</li>
<li>Utilized an algorithm that facilitates interpretation of variable contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project not only delivers a predictive tool for customer bookings but also sets the foundation for ongoing enhancements and optimizations to ensure sustained success in meeting business objectives. This was a British Airways job simulation project.</p>
