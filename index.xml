      <description>This has to be one of the intense project I have worked on in my early days of Data Science, I was in a team that was tasked to develop a movie recommender system using the unsupervised technique called recommender systems. We built this recommender system and deployed it using streamlit and made it accessible by internet using AWS.
We used movie lens dataset to complete this project, we downloaded the multiple files for the movie lens dataset and used them to accomplish our project.</description>

      <title>Project 3: Language Identification Program</title>

      <description>Also enjoyed doing this project it&amp;rsquo;s a very simple project, I had dataset from NCHLT Text Corpora collected by the South African Department of Arts and Culture &amp;amp; Centre for Text Technology that contained 11 official South African languages. I had to build a program that will classify a sentence as which language does it belong to.
As with all project we started by cleaning the data we will be using to train our model.</description>

      <title>Project 2: Classification of Tweets</title>

      <description>In this project we were given a dataset that consisted of Tweets, we had to work on a classification model to classify whether a Tweet is from a user who believes in man-made climate change or not, this project is intense on the Natural Language Processing techniques. It was a great project to work on and it made me excited on the unending opportunites that Machine Learning present.
Began with Data Cleaning to remove all duplicates, punctuations, url links and special symbols that were not necessary for our model.</description>

      <description>As the world grapples with the crisis of climate change many countries are looking into moving more towards clean energy, I was working in a team that was given a project to work on predicting a load shortfall between electricity produced by fossil fuels and renewables.
We were given a dataset with historical weather conditions in different cities in Spain as features and the Load Shortfall.
We began with cleaning our dataset to ensure that our analysis and model will be accurate.</description>

      <description>I have graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand with Bachelor of Commerce majoring in Accounting. I have always been fascinated by data and statistics, after learning about a field called Data Science where I can spend my time unlocking valuable insights from data and use the data to develop computational models that can make predictions and classify information, I knew from that day on that this is a job I wanted to do.</description>
