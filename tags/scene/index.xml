      <description>As the world grapples with the crisis of climate change many countries are looking into moving more towards clean energy, I was working in a team that was given a project to work on predicting a load shortfall between electricity produced by fossil fuels and renewables.
We were given a dataset with historical weather conditions in different cities in Spain as features and the Load Shortfall.
We began with cleaning our dataset to ensure that our analysis and model will be accurate.</description>
